    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: sans-serif;">
Project Name: IoT Automated Dispensing System (Prototype)
Ownership: Individual (R&D Phase)

1. Acceptance of Terms: By interacting with this automated dispensing interface ("The System"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. This system is currently in a Research and Development (R&D) phase intended for testing machine-to-machine payment triggers and mechanical dispensing accuracy.

2. Nature of Service: The Service provided is the automated dispensing of liquids via a microcontroller-integrated Android interface. This system is a private utility prototype and is not currently deployed for general public commercial use. Users participating in this R&D phase acknowledge that the system is a work-in-progress.

3. Payment and Digital Transactions: Payment Processor: All transactions are processed through Razorpay. Transaction Timeout: For security and hardware synchronization, each generated UPI QR code is valid for exactly 45 seconds. If payment is not completed within this window, the transaction will automatically expire. Dynamic Pricing: Prices are calculated based on the quantity (cups) selected by the user.

4. Hardware Safety & User Conduct: Users must not interfere with the electrical or mechanical components of the machine. Any attempt to bypass the payment interface or reverse-engineer the "MainActivity" software is strictly prohibited. 

5. Limitation of Liability: As this is an R&D prototype: The system is provided on an "As-Is" basis. The owner shall not be held liable for accidental spills, mechanical delays, or variations in dispensing volume. Liability is limited strictly to the transaction amount (₹) in the event of a verified technical failure.

6. Intellectual Property: The software logic (Kotlin/Node.js), hardware integration design, and UI are the intellectual property of the developer.
