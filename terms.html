Project Name: IoT Automated Dispensing System (Prototype)
[cite_start]Ownership: Individual (R&D Phase) [cite: 15]

1. Acceptance of Terms: By interacting with this automated dispensing interface, you agree to these Terms. [cite_start]This system is in an R&D phase for testing payment triggers[cite: 15, 16].

2. [cite_start]Nature of Service: This is a private utility prototype for automated liquid dispensing via a microcontroller-integrated Android interface[cite: 17, 18].

3. [cite_start]Payment: All transactions are processed through Razorpay[cite: 20]. [cite_start]QR codes are valid for exactly 45 seconds; otherwise, the transaction expires[cite: 21, 22].

4. Hardware Safety: Users must not interfere with mechanical components. [cite_start]Reverse-engineering the software is prohibited[cite: 24, 25].

5. Liability: Provided "As-Is." [cite_start]The owner is not liable for accidental spills or minor dispensing variations[cite: 27, 28].
